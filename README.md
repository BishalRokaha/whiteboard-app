## 🎯 Why This Project?

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of:
- React state management for complex interactions
- Canvas-based rendering
- Undo/Redo implementation using reducers
- Building and deploying a production-ready frontend application

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Mouse events such as `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` are used to track user interaction.
- When the mouse is pressed, drawing begins by capturing cursor coordinates.
- As the mouse moves, continuous lines are drawn between points using the Canvas API.
- React hooks manage drawing state and control logic, while the canvas handles rendering.
